# stbridge

Python wrapper for STLINK-V3-BRIDGE.

## Supported features
* SPI master
* I2C master
* GPIO

## How to Install (WIP)
Need boost-python and fmt libs.

Basically get the src/ folder from STLINK-V3-BRIDGE and get the libSTLinkUSBDriver.dylib or .so from STM32CubeProg. Run make. Currently only MacOS and Linux are supported. If working on ARM use https://github.com/martonmiklos/STLINK-V3-BRIDGE_libusb but just copy the changed files that use libusb.

## How to Use (WIP)
Read the code
